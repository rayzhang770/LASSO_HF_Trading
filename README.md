Summary
· Goal: explore the effect of Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) in the prediction of rolling 1-minute-ahead return.

· Motivation: motivated by an awesome paper Sparse Signals in the Cross-Section of Returns (Alex, Adam, & Mao, 2017), which was published on the Journal of Finance.

· Results: average of 0.6% out-of-sample R^2 for the combination strategy of LASSO and AR(3) model.
